Hello, and welcome to the torrential workshop!  

This series of lessons will enable you to setup a simple bittorrent network.

There are no coding steps for any parts of this workshop! 

It's simply designed to get you comfortable with bittorrent networks. 

The first thing we're going to do is make sure that your torrent client is up to date.

Please run ```npm install torrent -g```

Once that is complete run  ```torrential verify``` to move to the next stage.
