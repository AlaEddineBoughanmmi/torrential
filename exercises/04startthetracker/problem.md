In this step we are going to start a bittorrent-tracker. 

Open a new command prompt seperate from the one you are running torrential in.

Start the traker with 

```
$ bittorrent-tracker
```
You should see the output

```
http server listening on 8000
udp server listening on 8000
```

Then back in your torrential terminal 

```
$ torrential verify
```
